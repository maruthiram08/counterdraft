Got it. Thank you for the correction — this is important.

Below is a **pure conceptual rewrite** of the plan in **clear, copyable Markdown**, with **no code**, **no file paths**, and **no implementation details**.
This is a **product + architecture + brain spec**, written so that:

* You can reason about it
* You can share it with design / product / founders
* Engineering can later derive code from it
* There is **zero room for assumptions**
* Every place where **user input is needed explicitly maps to a UI surface or new module**

This is the **clean, final version** of the plan.

# 🧠 Counterdraft Brain — V1 Product & Architecture Specification (No Code)

---

## 1. What the Brain Is

The Brain is a **deterministic decision system** that sits behind the product.

Its job is **not to generate content**.
Its job is to **decide**:

* what information is required
* whether an idea is worth developing
* what the post should optimize for
* what belief or tension it should anchor to
* how confident the system is in the outcome

The Brain always runs **before** any AI generation.

AI systems are **workers**.
The Brain is **editorial judgment**.

---

## 2. What the Brain Is Not

The Brain is **not**:

* an AI agent
* a prompt
* a framework selector UI
* a content teacher
* a virality predictor
* a blocker of user actions

The Brain **never**:

* forces inputs immediately
* downgrades user work
* blocks publishing
* assumes missing information

---

## 3. The Single Decision Spine (Locked)

Every Brain decision flows from **one question only**:

> **What outcome should this content item optimize for?**

Valid outcomes (exactly one):

* Authority (be trusted, respected)
* Engagement (start conversation)
* Conversion (drive action)
* Connection (build relationship)

If the outcome is unclear:

* the Brain infers provisionally
* confidence is reduced
* the UI is notified softly

No other decision is allowed to lead.

---

## 4. The 10% That Drives 90% of Value (V1 Scope)

In V1, the Brain optimizes for **only four things**:

1. Is this idea worth writing at all?
2. What outcome should it optimize for?
3. What belief or tension should anchor it?
4. What structure best serves that outcome on this platform?

Everything else is intentionally ignored.

This scope is frozen for V1.

---

## 5. When the Brain Runs

The Brain runs **automatically**, but **not constantly**.

It runs only on these moments:

* When a new Idea is created
* When an Idea moves to “In Development”
* When “In Development” becomes a Draft
* When a Draft is Published

The Brain does **not** run:

* on every keystroke
* on every edit
* when a Draft is merely opened

This avoids noise, cost, and decision churn.

---

## 6. Required Inputs (Content-Item Level)

All inputs are **per content item**.
The Brain does not rely on profile defaults, though it may recommend reuse.

### 6.1 Hard Dependencies (Quality-Critical)

These inputs must exist for **high-confidence** output.

| Input                  | Purpose            | How It Appears in UI  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Outcome                | Decision spine     | Inline Outcome Picker |
| Audience (role + pain) | Relevance & tone   | Audience Mini-Card    |
| Topic                  | Subject clarity    | Idea Card (existing)  |
| Stance                 | Editorial position | Stance Toggle         |

If any are missing:

* the Brain marks the item as **Needs Context**
* the UI shows a subtle badge
* the user may ignore or skip

The Brain **never interrupts** the user.

---

### 6.2 Soft Dependencies (Optional, Never Blocking)

These improve quality but are not required.

| Input                  | When Relevant         | UI Pattern        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Proof / examples       | Authority, Conversion | Inline suggestion |
| Platform preference    | Multi-publish         | Settings hint     |
| Prior belief reference | Repetition detected   | Context badge     |

---

## 7. Deferred Input Collection Rule (Critical)

The Brain follows a strict rule:

> **Detect first. Ask later. Never interrupt.**

Process:

1. Brain detects missing or weak input
2. Brain records it internally
3. UI surfaces it non-blockingly
4. User may:

   * provide input
   * skip intentionally
   * proceed anyway

Skipping is allowed and tracked.

---

## 8. Internal Brain Decision Flow (Invisible by Default)

### Step 1: Outcome Resolution

* Use user-provided outcome if present
* Otherwise infer provisionally
* Lower confidence if inferred
* Mark outcome as missing context if weak

UI:

* Inline picker
* Explanation only if user asks “Why?”

---

### Step 2: Belief or Tension Anchor

* If idea originated from a belief or tension → auto-anchor
* Otherwise infer best-fit belief
* If confidence is low → mark anchor as weak

If contradiction with past beliefs is found:

* Brain marks **Belief Conflict**
* UI highlights gently (no blocking)

---

### Step 3: Structural Decision (System-Only)

The Brain decides internally:

* content type (observation, actionable, story, comparison)
* dominant psychological mode

These decisions:

* are not shown to the user
* guide later execution
* cannot be manually selected in V1

---

### Step 4: Readiness & Confidence

The Brain assigns:

* Low confidence (missing core inputs)
* Medium confidence
* High confidence

UI shows this **visually**, not verbally.

---

## 9. New UI States Introduced by the Brain

The Brain may introduce the following **non-blocking states**:

| State           | Meaning                        | User Experience             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Needs Context   | Missing core input             | Badge on card               |
| Low Confidence  | Weak assumptions               | Dotted progress             |
| Belief Conflict | Contradiction found            | Highlight + optional action |
| Repetitive Idea | Similar belief already covered | Warning chip                |

These states **inform**, not control.

---

## 10. Mapping to Command Center

### Ideas Column

* Brain evaluates novelty and worth
* States shown:

  * Idea
  * Idea (Needs Context)
  * Idea (Repetitive)

---

### In Development Column

* Brain performs full evaluation
* Missing inputs surfaced softly
* Confidence indicator visible

---

### Drafts Column

* Brain does not re-evaluate structure
* Shows belief context and conflicts
* Explanations available on demand

---

### Live Column

* On publish:

  * beliefs are extracted
  * belief graph updated
  * new tensions may be created

---

## 11. Explain-on-Demand Model

By default:

* Brain decisions are invisible

If the user asks “Why?”:

* The system explains:

  * what decision was made
  * which inputs influenced it
  * what would improve confidence

The system never exposes:

* frameworks
* psychological terms
* internal scoring

---

## 12. Trace Logging System (Mandatory)

Every Brain run produces a **trace record**.

Trace logs capture:

* trigger event
* inputs known vs inferred
* decisions made
* confidence level
* missing context
* user overrides (if any)

Purpose:

* debug failures
* understand drop-offs
* evaluate decision quality
* train future improvements

No trace = no trust.

---

## 13. Relationship to AI Systems

The Brain outputs a **Decision & Constraint Summary**.

AI systems:

* receive the summary
* generate content accordingly
* cannot override Brain decisions

If Brain confidence is low:

* AI should proceed cautiously
* never invent missing intent

---

## 14. Explicit V1 Non-Goals

In V1, the Brain will **not**:

* predict engagement or virality
* optimize posting time
* suggest frequency
* teach frameworks
* expose templates
* block publishing

These are intentionally excluded.

---

## 15. Success Criteria (Brain-Level)

The Brain is successful if:

* users write fewer but stronger posts
* repetition decreases over time
* belief conflicts surface naturally
* users feel guided, not managed
* trace logs clearly explain failures

---

## 16. V1 Freeze Rule

No expansion of Brain scope until:

* at least 30% of ideas reach Live
* confidence correlates with user satisfaction
* trace logs show stable patterns

---

### Final Note

This rewrite:

* aligns fully with your current architecture
* removes all implementation assumptions
* clearly separates **decision**, **input**, and **execution**
* explicitly maps **every input to a UI surface**
* makes future engineering work unambiguous

---

# 1️⃣ Exact UI Components (V1)

This is a **design inventory**, not wireframes.
Each component exists because the **Brain requires or surfaces something**.

---

## A. Atomic Components (Reusable)

These are the smallest UI primitives the Brain depends on.

---

### 1. Outcome Picker

**Purpose**
Collect the *single decision spine input*.

**Type**
Inline selector (not modal).

**UI**

* Label: “What should this post optimize for?”
* Options (single-select):

  * Authority
  * Engagement
  * Conversion
  * Connection

**Behavior**

* Appears only when Brain marks `outcome` missing
* Defaults to inferred value (if any), visually marked “Suggested”
* User can:

  * accept suggestion
  * change it
  * ignore entirely

**Brain Contract**

* If user ignores → Brain keeps inferred value, confidence stays lower
* User choice overrides inference

---

### 2. Audience Mini-Card

**Purpose**
Capture audience without forcing a full persona flow.

**UI**
Compact card with 2 editable fields:

* “Who is this for?” (role / persona)
* “What are they struggling with right now?” (pain)

**Behavior**

* Inline expand/collapse
* Shows “You used a similar audience last time” as suggestion (non-clicky hint)

**Brain Contract**

* Missing audience → `Needs Context`
* Generic pain (“growth”, “learn”) → flagged silently, confidence reduced

---

### 3. Stance Toggle

**Purpose**
Force editorial posture.

**UI**
Three-option segmented control:

* Supportive
* Contrarian
* Exploratory

**Behavior**

* Inline, one tap
* Defaults to inferred stance if available

**Brain Contract**

* Contrarian stance without belief anchor → triggers `Belief Conflict` risk flag

---

### 4. Confidence Indicator

**Purpose**
Communicate quality without judgment.

**UI**

* Visual only (no text by default)
* Three states:

  * Dotted ring → Low confidence
  * Solid ring → Medium
  * Solid + subtle glow → High

**Behavior**

* Hover / tap → “Why?” affordance

**Brain Contract**

* Confidence is Brain-owned
* User cannot manually set it

---

### 5. Context Badge

**Purpose**
Surface Brain annotations non-intrusively.

**Variants**

* Needs Context
* Belief Conflict
* Repetitive Idea
* Weak Anchor

**UI**
Small pill/badge on content card.

**Behavior**

* Click opens explanation drawer
* Never blocks actions

---

## B. Composed Components (Brain-Aware)

These combine atomic components into Brain-aware surfaces.

---

### 6. Idea Card (Enhanced)

**Lives in:** Ideas column

**Contains**

* Idea title / hook
* Context badges (if any)
* Confidence indicator
* Primary action: “Develop”

**Optional Inline Additions**

* Outcome Picker (if missing)
* Stance Toggle (if missing)

**Brain Role**

* First evaluation happens here
* Marks idea as:

  * viable
  * repetitive
  * needing context

---

### 7. Development Header Panel

**Lives in:** In Dev column, top of editor

**Contains**

* Outcome (editable)
* Audience Mini-Card
* Stance Toggle
* Confidence Indicator
* “Why am I seeing this?” link

**Behavior**

* Collapsible
* Sticky while in Dev

**Brain Role**

* This is where deferred inputs are most likely resolved
* Brain re-evaluates when user edits any of these

---

### 8. Explain-on-Demand Drawer

**Purpose**
Transparency without noise.

**Triggered by**

* Clicking a badge
* Clicking “Why?” near confidence indicator

**Shows**

* What decision was made
* What input influenced it
* What’s missing (if anything)
* What would improve confidence

**Explicitly Does NOT Show**

* Framework names
* Psychological jargon
* Scores

---

### 9. Belief Context Sidebar (Editor)

**Lives in:** Draft editor sidebar

**Shows**

* Relevant belief(s)
* Any detected tension
* One-line note:

  * “You’ve expressed a conflicting view before”

**Actions**

* “Address this”
* “Ignore”

**Brain Contract**

* Ignoring is allowed
* Choice is logged for trace analysis

---

## C. New UI States (Visual Language)

| Brain State     | UI Expression                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Needs Context   | Grey badge + low confidence            |
| Low Confidence  | Dotted progress + subtle warning color |
| Belief Conflict | Highlighted belief in sidebar          |
| Repetitive Idea | Yellow chip + hover explanation        |

No modals. No blocking.

---

# 2️⃣ One Real User Flow (End-to-End)

Let’s walk through **one realistic flow**, no happy-path cheating.

---

## User Profile (Implicit)

* Founder
* Posts on LinkedIn occasionally
* Has beliefs already extracted
* No interest in “learning copywriting”

---

## Step 1: User Creates an Idea

**Action**
User clicks “+ New Idea” and types:

> “AI tools are making junior roles obsolete”

**What the Brain Does (Automatically)**

* Evaluates idea
* Infers:

  * Outcome → Authority (low confidence)
  * Stance → Contrarian
* Anchors to existing belief: “AI accelerates skill gaps”

**UI Result**

* Idea card appears with:

  * “Needs Context” badge
  * Low confidence indicator
* Inline Outcome Picker appears (collapsed)

User ignores everything and clicks **Develop**.

---

## Step 2: Idea Moves to “In Dev”

**Brain Runs Again**

Finds:

* Outcome still inferred
* Audience missing
* Stance inferred but unconfirmed

**UI (Development Header Panel Appears)**

User now sees:

* Outcome Picker (suggested: Authority)
* Audience Mini-Card (empty)
* Stance Toggle (Contrarian preselected)
* Confidence indicator (low)

User actions:

* Accepts Outcome = Authority
* Fills Audience:

  * Role: “Early-career software engineers”
  * Pain: “Unsure if their skills will matter in 3 years”
* Leaves stance as is

---

## Step 3: Brain Re-Evaluates

**Now Brain Has**

* Explicit outcome
* Explicit audience
* Clear stance
* Strong belief anchor

**Brain Updates**

* Confidence → Medium
* Removes “Needs Context” badge

**UI**

* Confidence indicator updates
* No interruption
* User continues writing

---

## Step 4: Drafting Begins

**Editor Opens**

**Sidebar Shows**

* Relevant belief:

  * “AI widens the gap between fast and slow learners”
* Tension alert:

  * “You’ve also said AI creates more entry points”

User clicks **Address this**.

Brain logs this choice.

---

## Step 5: Draft is Completed

User clicks **Publish**.

**Brain Final Run**

* Confirms outcome, audience, stance
* Freezes structure
* Emits execution summary
* Confidence → High

---

## Step 6: Post Goes Live

**After Publish**

* Belief extraction runs
* Brain compares:

  * Old beliefs
  * New expression
* Detects nuanced evolution (not contradiction)

**Result**

* New belief confidence updated
* No new tension created

---

## Step 7: Future Benefit (Invisible)

Next time user creates an idea about AI + careers:

* Brain recognizes repetition risk earlier
* Suggests a different angle
* User feels “this thing actually remembers how I think”

---

# Final Reality Check

What you now have is:

* A **Brain that decides, not generates**
* UI components that exist **only because the Brain needs them**
* A flow that:

  * never blocks
  * never lectures
  * never overwhelms
* A system that gets **smarter over time**, not noisier
