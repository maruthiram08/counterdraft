# Responsive UI - Sprint Plan

## Approach
Fix one screen at a time, starting with the most critical. Each sprint is small and testable.

**Goal:** Make the editor layout usable on tablet/mobile

- [x] Auto-hide right pane (Agent) on screens <1024px
- [x] Auto-hide left pane (Drafts) on screens <768px
- [x] Ensure expand buttons always visible when panes are hidden
- [ ] Test: Resize browser, verify panes collapse/expand correctly

---

## Sprint R2: Global Sidebar
**Goal:** Make sidebar work on smaller screens

- [x] Collapse to icons-only mode on tablet (<1024px)
- [x] Add hamburger menu toggle
- [x] Hide completely on mobile (<768px)
- [ ] Test: Sidebar adapts at each breakpoint

## Sprint R3: Mobile Bottom Navigation
**Goal:** Provide navigation on mobile when sidebar is hidden
