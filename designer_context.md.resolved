# Counterdraft: Design Context & Brief

## 1. The Core Philosophy
**Counterdraft** is the antidote to "AI Slop."
While other tools generate generic, soulless content at scale, Counterdraft is built for **Thought Leaders** who care about depth, nuance, and strategy.

*   **We are not** a "Magic Button" that writes for you.
*   **We are** a "Thinking Partner" that helps you articulate your unique beliefs and repurpose them intelligently.
*   **The Mantra**: "Deep Work First, Automate Second."

## 2. Who is this for?
*   **Subject Matter Experts**: Founders, executives, and consultants who need to share *real* expertise.
*   **The "Anti-Influencer"**: People who hate clickbait but understand they need a digital presence.
*   **Visual Storytellers**: Those who want their ideas to look as good as they sound (via Smart Studio).

## 3. Product Metaphors & Architecture

### 🧠 The Brain (Strategy Layer)
Everything starts with strategy, not random prompts.
*   **Inputs**: Audience, Outcome (Goal), Stance (Controversial? Earnest?), Format.
*   **The Vibe**: Precision, Control, Instrument Panel. Not a "chat box."

### 🎛 The Command Center (Workflow Layer)
A Kanban-style view of your intellectual property pipeline.
*   **Stages**: Ideas → Developing → Drafts → Published.
*   **The Vibe**: Clarity, Progress, "Inbox Zero" for your mind.

### 🎨 The Smart Studio (Production Layer)
Where deep thoughts become visual assets.
*   **The Feature**: "Repurpose Engine." One "Source of Truth" document becomes a LinkedIn post, a Twitter thread, and a Carousel instantly.
*   **The Magic**: We don't just crop text; we use AI to "Semantically Remix" content and generate pixel-perfect visuals (via the new **Smart Studio** engine).

## 4. Aesthetic & Tone
We are building a **Pro Tool**, not a toy.
*   **Keywords**: Editorial, Lucid, Calm, Powerful, "Stripe for Thought Leadership."
*   **Typography**: Clean sans-serifs (Inter/Outfit) that feel modern but timeless.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   **Dark Mode First**: Sleek, premium feel.
    *   **Glassmorphism**: Subtle depth and layers (e.g., our new Overlay Sidebar).
    *   **Motion**: Smooth, staggered transitions—never jarring.

## 5. The Homepage Objective
We are upgrading the homepage to reflect this premium status.
*   **Goal**: Communicate "This is a serious tool for serious thinkers" within 3 seconds.
*   **Hero Section**: Needs to showcase the **Command Center** and **Smart Studio** in action.
*   **Feature Highlight**: Show the "One Draft → Many Formats" flow visually.
*   **Social Proof**: Testimonials from "Smart People," not just "Marketers."

## 6. Current Feature Set (For Visualization)
*   **Interactive Outlines**: Users edit the skeleton of their ideas before generating.
*   **Wide-Screen Repurpose Modal**: A massive 2-column studio for adapting content.
*   **Draggable Kanban**: Smooth drag-and-drop management of content cards.
*   **Concept Cards**: "Beliefs" and "Tensions" that float as inspirational objects.

> **Designer Note**: Avoid "AI Sparkles" and "Magic Wands" as primary motifs. Use purposeful iconography (gears, brains, structural grids) instead. We are building an *engine*, not a *toy*.
