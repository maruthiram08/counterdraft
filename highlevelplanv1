Below is a **clean, copy-paste ready PRD + TRD** written the way a **senior PM / founding team** would actually use it.
No fluff. No aspirational garbage. Built for execution.


---

# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name (Working)

> **Foreword**
> *(Replace later if needed — structure remains valid)*

---

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 One-Line Definition

**Foreword is a thinking partner that helps creators clarify, sharpen, and evolve their beliefs before those beliefs turn into content.**

---

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Knowledge creators do **not** suffer from a lack of ideas.
They suffer from:

* Repetition of the same ideas
* Dilution of beliefs over time
* Shallow or derivative thinking
* Inability to articulate tensions in their own POV

Existing tools optimize for **content output**, not **thinking quality**.

---

### 1.3 Target Users (MVP)

**Primary ICP**

* Founders, operators, consultants, PMs
* Post consistently on LinkedIn
* Care about authority, not virality
* Have opinions (not news curators)

**Explicitly Out of Scope**

* Meme creators
* Growth hackers
* Social media managers
* “Post daily” content farms

---

### 1.4 Core User Job (JTBD)

> *“Help me understand what I actually believe, where my thinking is repetitive or shallow, and what idea is worth expressing next.”*

---

## 2. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Beliefs > Posts**
2. **Judgment > Generation**
3. **Restraint > Volume**
4. **Longitudinal thinking > Session-based AI**
5. **Trust > Virality**

If a feature violates any of the above, it is rejected.

---

## 3. Canonical Object

### 3.1 Creator Belief Graph

The belief graph is the **single source of truth**.

It consists of:

* Core beliefs
* Rejected beliefs
* Overused beliefs
* Emerging beliefs
* Unresolved tensions

All outputs are projections of this object.

---

## 4. MVP Scope (V1)

### 4.1 Input: Creator Memory Ingestion

**User Inputs**

* LinkedIn profile URL OR manual paste
* Last 50–100 posts
* Optional:

  * Notes
  * Drafts
  * Saved inspirations

**Out of Scope (V1)**

* Auto multi-platform ingestion
* Real-time syncing

---

### 4.2 Core Engine: Belief Extraction

System extracts:

* **5–7 Core Beliefs**

  * Plain language
  * Opinionated
* **3 Overused Angles**

  * Signals repetition risk
* **2–3 Tensions**

  * Conflicting beliefs
  * Unresolved tradeoffs
* **1 Emerging Thesis**

  * Directional belief evolution

---

### 4.3 Output: Idea Direction (NOT Content)

System provides:

* Top 3 ideas worth expressing next
* Explanation of:

  * Which belief it strengthens
  * What tension it explores
  * What belief it risks weakening
* Optional:

  * One suggested opening line

**Explicitly Not Provided**

* Full post drafts
* Formatting
* Emojis
* Hooks library

---

### 4.4 UX & Tone

* Editorial, calm, private
* Feels like a thinking notebook
* Avoid dashboards, feeds, gamification

---

## 5. MVP Non-Goals (Won’t Build List)

* ❌ Scheduling
* ❌ Analytics
* ❌ Multi-platform publishing
* ❌ Virality scoring
* ❌ Engagement hacks
* ❌ Daily prompts

---

## 6. Success Metrics (Qualitative First)

**Primary**

* Users describe product as:

  > “An editor for my thinking”

**Secondary**

* Repeat usage after week 2
* Users manually referencing belief insights in their writing

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                 | Mitigation                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Output feels generic | Aggressive belief deduplication |
| User distrust        | Editorial tone + restraint      |
| Over-automation      | Human-in-loop early             |
| Feature creep        | Hard MVP scope lock             |

---

## 8. Future Scope (Explicitly Deferred)

* Belief-anchored drafting
* Multi-platform derivatives
* Longitudinal belief evolution
* Analytics & attribution

---

# 📄 Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

---

## 1. System Architecture (High Level)

```
User Input
→ Ingestion Layer
→ Belief Extraction Engine
→ Belief Graph Store
→ Insight Generator
→ UI Layer
```

---

## 2. Data Ingestion Layer

### 2.1 Inputs

* Text posts (LinkedIn)
* Optional long-form notes

### 2.2 Processing

* Cleaning (remove emojis, links)
* Sentence segmentation
* Time-ordering

---

## 3. Belief Extraction Engine

### 3.1 Core Tasks

* Topic clustering
* Opinion polarity detection
* Repetition detection
* Contradiction detection
* Belief summarization

### 3.2 Output Schema (Belief Object)

```json
{
  "belief_id": "string",
  "statement": "string",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "first_seen": "date",
  "last_seen": "date",
  "supporting_posts": []
}
```

---

## 4. Tension Detection Module

Detect:

* Contradictory beliefs
* Tradeoffs not explicitly addressed

Output:

```json
{
  "belief_a": "id",
  "belief_b": "id",
  "tension_summary": "string"
}
```

---

## 5. Overuse Detection

Logic:

* Frequency decay over time
* Semantic similarity threshold
* Topic saturation scoring

Output:

* Flag beliefs with diminishing marginal insight

---

## 6. Insight Generator

Generates:

* Emerging belief hypothesis
* Idea directions (belief-anchored)
* Suppression suggestions (“don’t write this”)

---

## 7. Storage

* User profile store
* Belief graph store
* Temporal belief history

No need for real-time sync in MVP.

---

## 8. UI Layer

### 8.1 Core Screens

1. Belief Overview
2. Tensions & Contradictions
3. Idea Directions
4. Belief History (read-only)

### 8.2 UX Constraints

* Minimal controls
* No infinite feeds
* No social signals

---

## 9. Security & Privacy

* Private by default
* No public profiles
* No cross-user belief learning in MVP

---

## 10. Tech Stack (Suggested, Not Prescriptive)

* Frontend: React / Next.js
* Backend: Node / Python/ Bun
* Storage: Postgres/Supabase
* AI: LLM + embeddings
* Hosting: Vercel 

---

## 11. Out of Scope (TRD)

* Mobile app
* Browser extension
* Public sharing
* Team collaboration

---

# ✅ Final Sanity Check

If this product works:

* Creators post **less**
* Their ideas feel **sharper**
* Their thinking **evolves**
* Output compounds across platforms later
