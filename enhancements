In development workflow - there is missing userflow to intitate the content development process. Current steps in the CD process involve 1) Research 2) Outline 3) Draft preparation

Current reserach process is not tailored to the type of the content. User should be able to attach references to the research process - supported references for MVP - markdowns, urls (tool-call capability to be confirmed), text, word documents.

Once the agent generates the research - user should be able to preview, add inline comments (similar to the flow implemented in the maineditor page). There should be an option available fo export research to a md file. alternatively when taps on redo-research we can trigger this flow.. (Pros & Cons to be analysed). We should consider the brain/rules engine to be in-line with this. 

Outline Process - Currently the outline preview generated is completely broken.
