I've investigated the font usage, and your intuition is correct. Here are my observations:

Serif Font (Newsreader)

Status: It is correctly loaded in 

layout.tsx
, but it is not defined in your Tailwind configuration (

globals.css
).
Impact: Components using font-serif (like 

BeliefCard
 and 

DraftModal
) are displaying the generic System Serif (e.g., Times New Roman) instead of the intended Newsreader font.
Mono Font (JetBrains Mono)

Status: Also loaded in 

layout.tsx
, but not defined in your Tailwind configuration.
Impact: Areas using font-mono (like parts of 

onboarding/page.tsx
) are displaying the generic System Monospace (e.g., Courier) instead of JetBrains Mono.
Sans Font (Inter)

Status: This is the only font currently wired up correctly in 

globals.css
 (--font-sans: 'Inter'...), which is why the main UI text looks correct.
Recommendation: We should update 

globals.css
 to map font-serif to var(--font-newsreader) and font-mono to var(--font-jetbrains) to fix these inconsistencies.
