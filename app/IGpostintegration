## Feature Context: Canva Handoff (Co-Creation, Not Rendering)

This product integrates with Canva as a **co-creation tool**, not as a rendering engine.

### Core Principle
Counterdraft is responsible for **editorial judgment and content intent**.  
Canva is responsible for **visual design and final presentation**.

The system must NEVER attempt to fully design visuals or auto-publish without user involvement.

---

### What the Canva Handoff Does
- Takes **finalized, Brain-approved content** (headline, body, CTA)
- Passes it to Canva in a structured way
- Opens Canva with:
  - Correct post format (e.g. LinkedIn post, Instagram square, carousel)
  - Text pre-filled into template placeholders
  - Clear hierarchy (primary vs secondary text)

This eliminates copy-paste and format confusion for the user.

---

### What the Canva Handoff Does NOT Do
- Does NOT choose fonts, colors, or layouts programmatically
- Does NOT auto-publish content
- Does NOT attempt “one-click final design”
- Does NOT replace Canva’s creative control

The user must always:
- See the design
- Adjust visuals if desired
- Explicitly export or publish

---

### UX Expectations
- The CTA should read: **“Design in Canva”**
- The interaction should feel like a smooth handoff, not automation
- Canva opens as a foreground experience
- Returning to Counterdraft is optional, not forced

---

### Brain Interaction Rules
- Canva handoff is only enabled when:
  - Content intent is locked
  - Brain confidence is medium or high
- The Brain passes **intent and structure**, not visual instructions
- Any Canva usage is treated as execution, not decision-making

---

### Success Criteria
The feature is successful if users say:
> “I didn’t have to think about formatting or copy-pasting — I just designed.”

If users expect Counterdraft to design visuals, the feature has failed.
